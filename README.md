# dUI

dUI is a component library I created and use for private projects, but open sourced in case anyone else find the stack as exciting as me. I like to experiment and use different types of frontend frameworks. But in order to feel productive and create great looking UIs it is useful to have a set of primitive components, no matter which framework I choose to use in a certain project. The goal of this project is to create a component library that is configurable and theamable, with global styles and components with good defaults. The techonologies used, as of right now, are:

- Panda CSS - Inspired a lot by Stitches, which I have used and loved while creating a component library at work, while compiling to CSS files for better performance. Since it compiles to CSS, it will also work with any of the frontend frameworks I use.
- Mitosis - A unified way to write components which compiles to native frontend framework components like Qwik, React, SolidJS, etc
- Bun - Because, let's see what the fuzz is all about!

Here we go...
